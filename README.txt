== Installation ==

1. Drag and drop `wp-freighter.zip` on WordPress /wp-admin/ under Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Known Limitations ⚠️ ==

= Requires customization to wp-config.php for web host compatibility. =
In order for WP Freighter to work, it needs to modify the wp-config.php file. This will happen automatically however if the file is locked down then WP Freighter will provide the necessary configurations for you to provide to your web host. If modifying wp-confg.php is not allowed by the web host provider then WP Freighter won’t be able to run.

= Root level files are shared. =
WP Freighter makes minimal changes to wp-config.php in order to allow for many WordPress sites on a single WordPress installation. Unfortunately that means root level files are shared between all sites. If root level files are needed I recommend coping files from the root / to /content/<stacked-id>/ and configure Redirection plugin to handle the redirection.
